# ldts-project-assignment-g0601

In this remastering of the classic game of 1976, "Breakout", there'll be bricks aligned on the top of the board and your job is to destroy all of them. In order to do that,
you need to try to hit the bricks with a constantly moving ball, by controlling a paddle. 

This project was developed by António Ferreira (up202004735@fe.up.pt), João Maldonado (up202004244@fe.up.pt) and Tomás Gomes (up202004393@fe.up.pt) for LDTS 2021/2022.
